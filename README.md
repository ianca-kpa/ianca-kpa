## 🌱 About me

I'm a biomedical scientist with a strong academic background and a growing passion for data science applied to public health.  
After earning a PhD in Tropical Medicine, I specialized in Digital Health and Data Science to combine analytical thinking with my experience in healthcare.  
I'm especially interested in open data, digital epidemiology, and building impactful tools using health information systems.
